# Bulls & cows
### simple game


The program greets the user and displays the introductory text.
The program then generates a secret 4-digit number (the digits must be unique and not start with 0).
The player guesses the number. The program notifies them if the entered number is shorter or longer than 4 digits, contains duplicates, starts with zero, or includes non-numeric characters.
The program evaluates the user's guess.
Furthermore, the program displays the number of bull/bulls (if the user guesses both the number and its position) and/or cows/cows (if the user guesses only the number, but not its position). # The returned evaluation should consider singular and plural forms in the output. For example, 1 bull and 2 bulls (same for cow/cows).
